#' Create explainer from your mljar model
#'
#' DALEX is designed to work with various black-box models like tree ensembles, linear models, neural networks etc.
#' Unfortunately packages that create such models are very inconsistent between many platforms and programming languages. Different tools use different interfaces to train, validate and use models.
#' One of those tools, we would like to make more accessible is mljar.
#'
#'
#' @param model object - a mljar model to be explained
#' @param project_title character - a name of project_title  in which model was built. Without it predictions are unreachable.
#' @param data data.frame or matrix - data that was used for fitting. If not provided then will be extracted from the model. Data should be passed without target column (this shall be provided as the \code{y} argument). NOTE: If target variable is present in the \code{data}, some of the functionalities my not work properly.
#' @param y numeric vector with outputs / scores. If provided then it shall have the same size as \code{data}
#' @param weights numeric vector with sampling weights. By default it's \code{NULL}. If provided then it shall have the same length as \code{data}
#' @param predict_function function that takes two arguments: model and new data and returns numeric vector with predictions
#' @param residual_function function that takes three arguments: model, data and response vector y. It should return a numeric vector with model residuals for given data. If not provided, response residuals (\eqn{y-\hat{y}}) are calculated.
#' @param ... other parameters
#' @param label character - the name of the model. By default it's extracted from the 'class' attribute of the model
#' @param verbose if TRUE (default) then diagnostic messages will be printed.
#' @param precalculate if TRUE (default) then 'predicted_values' and 'residuals' are calculated when explainer is created. This will happenn also if 'verbose' is TRUE
#' @param colorize if TRUE (default) then \code{WARNINGS}, \code{ERRORS} and \code{NOTES} are colorized. Will work only in the R console.
#' @param model_info a named list (\code{package}, \code{version}, \code{type}) containg information about model. If \code{NULL}, \code{DALEX} will seek for information on it's own.
#'
#' @return explainer object (\code{\link[DALEX]{explain}}) ready to work with DALEX
