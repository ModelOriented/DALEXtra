Description: Provides wrapper of scikit-learn machine learning models. 
  In applied machine learning, there 
  is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance 
  between interpretability and accuracy. 
  However, in field of the Interpretable Machine Learning, 
  there are more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models, 
  that are implemented in R. 
  DALEXtra creates DALEX explainer for models created using Python, 
  that may be used by any package from DryWhy.ai family.
Depends: 
  R (>= 3.5.0),
  DALEX (>= 0.4.7)
