Description: Provides wrapper of scikit-learn machine learning models. In applied machine learning, there is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance between interpretability and accuracy. However, in field of the Interpretable Machine Learning, there are more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models, that are implemented in R. DALEXtra creates DALEX explainer for models created using Python, that may be used by any package from DryWhy.ai family.
