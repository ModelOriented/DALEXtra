Description: Provides wrapper of various machine learning models. 
  In applied machine learning, there 
  is a strong belief that we need to strike a balance 
  between interpretability and accuracy. 
  However, in field of the interpretable machine learning, 
  there are more and more new ideas for explaining black-box models, 
  that are implemented in 'R'. 
  'DALEXtra' creates 'DALEX' Biecek (2018) <arXiv:1806.08915> explainer for many type of models
  including those created using 'python' 'scikit-learn' and 'keras' libraries.
