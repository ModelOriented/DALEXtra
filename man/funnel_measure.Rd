\title{Caluculate difference in performance in models across different categories}
\usage{
funnel_measure(champion, challengers,
  measure_function = DALEX::loss_root_mean_square, nbins = 5,
  partition_data = champion$data, cutoff = 0.01,
  cutoff_name = "Other", factor_conversion_threshold = 7,
  show_info = TRUE, categories = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{champion}{- explainer of champion model.}

\item{challengers}{- explainer of challenger model or list of explainers.}

\item{measure_function}{- measure function that calculates performance of model based on true observation and prediction.
Order of parameters is important and should be (y, y_hat). The measure calculated by the function
should have the property that lower score value indicates better model. By default it is RMSE.}

\item{nbins}{- Number of qunatiles (partition points) for numeric columns. In case when more than one qunatile have the same value, there will be less partition points.}

\item{partition_data}{- Data by which test dataset will be paritioned for computation. Can be either data.frame or character vector.
When second is passed, it has to indicate names of columns that will be extracted fromm test data.
By default full test data. If data.frame, number of rows has to be equal to number of rows in test data.}

\item{cutoff}{- Threshold for categorical data. Entries less frequent than specified value will be merged into one category.}

\item{cutoff_name}{- Name for new category that arised after merging entries less frequent than \code{cutoff}}

\item{factor_conversion_threshold}{- Numeric columns with lower number of unique values than value of this parameter will be treated as factors}

\item{show_info}{- Logical value indicating if progress bar should be shown.}

\item{categories}{- a named list of variable names that will be plotted in a different colour. By deafault it is partitioned on Features, Other Variables and Target.}
}
\value{
An object of the class \code{funnel_measure}

It is a named list containing following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{data} data.frame that consists of columns:
   \itemize{
   \item \code{Variable} Variable according to which partitions were made
   \item \code{Measure} Difference in measures. Positive value indicates that champion was better, while negative that challenger.
   \item \code{Label} String that defines subset of \code{Variable} values (partition rule).
   \item \code{Challenger} Label of challenger explainer that was used in \code{Measure}
   \item \code{Category} a category of the variable passed to function
   }
\item \code{models_info} data.frame containig inforamtion about models used in analysys
}
}
\description{
Function \code{funnel_measure} allows users to compare two models based on their explainers. It partitions dataset on which models were builded
and creates categories according to quantiles of columns in \code{parition data}. \code{nbins} parameter determinates number of qunatiles.
For each category difference in provided measure is being calculated. Positive value of that differnece means that Champion model
has better performance in specified category, while negative value means that one of the Challengers was better. Function allows
to compare multiple Challengers at once.
